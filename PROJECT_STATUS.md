- 🔄 Plugin system UI not yet implemented

## 📋 **Next Phase: Integration & Polish**

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 1)

1. **Fix Legacy Component Compatibility**
   ```bash
   # Update ChatPanel.tsx, CodeEditor.tsx, etc. to use new design system
   # Remove Chakra UI dependencies
   # Integrate with new Tubelight navigation
   ```

2. **Complete WebSocket Integration**
   ```bash
   # Connect useEnhancedWebSocket to new StudioLayout
   # Implement real-time streaming in new UI
   # Add reasoning drawer with live updates
   ```

3. **Plugin System UI**
   ```bash
   # Create plugin management interface
   # Add plugin installation/removal UI
   # Integrate with enhanced top bar
   ```

### Phase 2: Enhanced AI Orchestration (Week 2-3)

1. **Conversational Workshop Implementation**
   - Progressive discovery interface (Discover → Clarify → Commit)
   - Dynamic form generation from requirements gaps
   - Project charter creation and approval workflow

2. **Layer-by-Layer Enhancement System**

   - Visual layer selection interface
   - Dependency management and validation

3. **Quality Gate System**
   - Progressive validation with visual feedback
   - Compilation, testing, and security checks
   - Automated repair attempts with user feedback

### Phase 3: Production Features (Week 4-5)

1. **Multi-File Project Generation**
   - Complex project scaffolding
   - Dependency graph management
   - Git integration with branch management

2. **Collaborative Features**
   - Multi-user editing with real-time collaboration
   - Share links for project previews
   - Team workspace management

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Performance monitoring dashboard
   - Usage analytics and insights
   - Cost tracking and optimization
